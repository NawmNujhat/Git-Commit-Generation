Explanation:
The change made involves adding a new route that allows users to access items related to a specific manifestation when visiting a particular URL, and redirects them to a list of all items associated with the given manifestation ID. The addition of this route is similar to how the IdentifierType and Identifier were previously added (first example), so I've used a similar style for the commit message to convey that the code change adds a new route."
