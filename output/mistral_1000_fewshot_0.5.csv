14480b143ed982bb5538157b2f04b33c782a3191,angular_material,"perf(icon): avoid multiple renders on frequent changes

When the source value quickly changes it causing multiple icons rendering,
The `attr.$observe` callback gets executed twice, attempting to clear the container element, before the $mdIcon service's promise gets resolved.
This results in 2 SVGs getting appended to the element, without it being cleared.

Calling empty when the promise is resolved.
