This allows for better error handling and debugging since you can check the returned tasks and handle any errors before they are executed.

patch by dbrosius; reviewed by slebresne for CASSANDRA-<I>","Update StorageService.java to refactor access of KSMetaData instances in getPartitionerForKeyspace loop

This change updates the method `getPartitionerForKeyspace` in `StorageService.java`. The refactored version improves readability by replacing multiple calls to `Schema.instance.getNonSystemTables()` with iterating directly over the passed list of keyspaces, and accessing their corresponding KSMetaData instances using the list index instead. This refactor simplifies the code by eliminating unnecessary Schema lookups."

This change allows you to easily select an element by calling `element.select()` instead of using JavaScript's native `document.querySelector(selector)`. The `select()` method will internally call the appropriate `querySelector` method based on whether the element is a BrowserDOMElement or DOMElement instance.

Also, updated the blur() method in both classes to focus the element instead of blurring it. This is because focusing an element is more commonly used and provides better functionality in the context of this codebase."
